USAGE:

A brief overview of the function of the code-files -

bayesian_structure.c
  This module acts an interface between the game-code and other bbn-related modules in the bayesian/ directory. The
module specifies the connections between nodes in a Bayesian network and CPT for each of the nodes. Once the BBN's are
instantiated at the start of the game, the role of this module is to interface between game-code and the inference mod-
ule for updating the BBN.

inference_poly.c
  This module is used for performing inference on a BBN based on an evidence node. The implementation is based on 
Pearl's Belief Propagation algorithm for a DAG with a poly-tree topology (or singly-connected networks).

bayesian_network.c
  This module performs the task of creating and initializing a bayesian network structure based on the inputs provided
by the bayesian_structure.c module.

digraph_bayesian.c
  This module maintains the underlying DAG of the BBN.

digraph.c
  digraph_bayesian.c module is an extension of this module, in the sense that this module doesn't assume the graph 
structure to be of the tree form and doesn't have specific functions.

inference.c
  This module is deprecated and not in use now. Prior, it was used for inference purposes, but it's support for
inferencing was only for DAG's with a tree topology (single-root).

bayes_test.c, digraph_tester.c - These modules are deprecated, and were used for debugging the bbn's prior to 
integration with the game.
