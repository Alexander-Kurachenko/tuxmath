Build:
  * Refine NSIS installer for Windows (or perhaps executable
    itself) to create Start Menu link to options.txt file

    can be done without Autotools?

  * Consider changing default resolution to 800x600, maybe higher.

Interface:
  * Add more sound effects and music files

  * Add option for number-keys to control main menu and possible options
    (for mouseless scenarios where arrow keys might not be the available...
    is there such a thing as numeric-only keyboards for PCs???)
  * High-score table
  * Implement lockfile to prevent multiple invocations.

Game Play:
  * More entertaining "victory" and "defeat" screens
  * Add option to review missed questions to end-of-game screens

  * End-of-level calculations, bonuses and animations
  * Add special targets that restore shields or rebuild cities.
