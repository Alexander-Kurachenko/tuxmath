CHANGES.txt for "tuxmath"

2006.Jun.17 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 10)
  Docs:
    * Updates to README.txt and TODO.txt.
    * Version designated as 0.8 in README.txt, tuxmath.h, and Makefile.

2006.Jun.12 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 9)
  Game:
    * Command-line argument added to allow ending the game with
      "victory" when all questions in the defined list have been
      successfully answered.
    * Counter of remaining questions added to upper center of screen
      when operating in "defined list" mode.
    * LED numbers now display in "monitor" added to Tux's console
      when "defined list" mode selected".
    * Drawing of math question formulas overhauled, with support
      for display of negatives (e.g. 2 x -3 = ?). The program supports
      negative numbers for limits of question ranges, but for now
      this must be selected at compile time.
    * Support for questions formatted like ? + 2 = 4 and 2 + ? = 4, 
      in addition to default format (2 + 2 = ?).
    * Command-line options to select from the three question formats.

2006.May.16 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 8)
  Code:
    * Major changes to internal workings of program. Everything 
      related to generation of math questions is now handled by
      a backend called MathCards, which generates question lists
      based on parameters in a struct called math_opts. MathCards
      is (obviously) contained in two new files, mathcards.h and
      mathcards.c.  For now, many options can only be set at 
      compile time by changing the defaults in mathcards.h. 
      MathCards allows fine-grained control of the questions to
      be asked, and allows the player to "win" if all of the
      questions in the list are answered while the cities are
      still alive.  By default, game behavior is unchanged from
      previously.
    * Main game() function in game.c has been split into several
      smaller functions; updated to use MathCards. 
    * Options() updated to use MathCards.
  Game:
    * demo mode now handles negative answers properly.

  Note: the code contains many FIXMEs and TODOs and should be
      tested more before being packaged for a distribution.
      I would describe revision 8 as a developer or alpha release.
