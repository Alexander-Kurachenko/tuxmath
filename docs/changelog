changelog for "tuxmath"

2007.Aug.19 (svn.debian.org/tux4kids - revision 199)
  Build: 
    * fix a path in Makefile.am for installing the locales

      Holger Levsen (holger@layer-acht.org)
   
2007.Apr.29 (svn.debian.org/tux4kids - revision 174)
  Build:
    * Makefile.am files added to all directories with EXTRA_DIST
      lists to get "make dist" to generate a working tarball.  It
      now seems to work correctly, although "make distcheck" fails
      because msgfmt cannot find the locales to generate the .mo
      files while doing the test install (a real "make install"
      works correctly, at least on my system).

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2007.Apr.11 
  Version 1.5.1

  Game:
    * Enabled play of custom game based on user's option file.
  Graphics:
    * Tweaked black_outline() slightly to improve font appearance.
  Docs:
    * Updated changelog, README.txt, INSTALL.txt.

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2007.Apr.09 (svn.debian.org/tux4kids - revision 150)
  Game:
    * Fixed lesson order bug - code now explicitly sorts the
      lesson files by alphabetical order of filenames.

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2007.Apr.07 (svn.debian.org/tux4kids - revision 149)
  Game:
    * Partially implemented high-score table in place (no support
      yet for player to put in own name).
    * Font rendering addressed - black_outline() now works as
      intended (perhaps appearance can be improved).

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2007.Mar.15 (svn.debian.org/tux4kids - revision ??? & ???)
  Build:
    * First revision adds Xcode building for MacOSX
    * Second commit removes the earlier (incomplete) approach to a
	UNIX-style build. (This was abandoned mainly for reasons of
	building Universal Binaries---the SDL Frameworks supposedly
	only work with Xcode)
	
        Tim Holy < holy at wustl period edu >
	
2007.Mar.08  (svn.debian.org/tux4kids - revision 125)
  Game:
    * High scores now saved to and read from file, not yet
      visible to game player.
    * svn repository move completed.

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2007.Mar.05  (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 75)
  Code:
    * Most of tuxtype-derived code now using functions in
      fileops.c to load - trying to make this more consistent
      and unified. Fixes problems finding data files on some
      Windows machines.
    * Beginning of audit of all pointers to prevent segfaults and
      other memory management errors.
  Game:
    * Data structures and several functions in place for high score
      lists (nothing user-visible yet).

      Last commit at svn.tux4kids.net before move to Alioth.

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2007.Feb.12  (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 74)
  Code:
    * Fixed MC_FORMULA_LEN bug causing long comet strings to
      drop last character.
    * Added new fields to game_options (bonus_comet_interval,
      bonus_speed_ratio) with relevant support functions.
    * Further implementation and cleanup of new menus.
      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

  Game:
    * Implementation of bonus comets that cause an igloo to
      be rebuilt.
      Tim Holy <holy@wustl.edu>
    * Many additional lesson files.
      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

  Build:
    * Andika font now default, included under data/fonts.
      Karl Ove Hufthammer <karl@huftis.org>

2007.Jan.31 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 72)
  Game/Graphics:
    * New graphics in which Tux protects igloo-dwelling
      penguins rather than cities. The older "city" mode still
      works and is selectable via the config file.
    * Restoration of lost igloo after each two waves.

      Tim Holy <holy@wustl.edu>

2007.Jan.24 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 69)
  Options:
    * More progress on new menu system, generally works
      correctly to extent that things have been implemented.
      More 'lesson' files added, now up through addition and
      subtraction of two-digit positive numbers.
  Game:
    * "Typing Tutor" mode added for kids just beginning to 
      use the keyboard.

      New menu still "alpha" - would not suggest packaging
      for Debian yet.

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2007.Jan.12 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 67)
  Options:
    * Overhaul of menu system well underway, suitable for
      alpha/developer preview status.  New menus prominently
      feature a series of prepared "lessons" to be completed,
      as well as arcade-style settings of varying difficulty
      that will ultimately be used to compete for high scores.
      New menus are basically functional but far from complete.
  Graphics:
    * Several very nice space-themed backgrounds adapted from
      "cosmos" backgrounds directory in Gnome, which I believe
      should be OK from licensing standpoint.
  Code:
    * Bugfix - question_copies parameter now handled correctly
      in read_config_file().

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2006.Dec.07 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 65)
  Options:
    * Several files brought in from tuxtype as part of overhaul
      of titlescreen and menu system: titlescreen.h (header for
      all of tuxtype-derived files), titlescreen.c, loaders.c,
      audio.c, gettext.c, alphabet.c, pause.c, theme.c.  The
      program again compiles and runs, but none of the new code
      is actually used yet.  Still under heavy construction.
  Build:
    * SDL_ttf now needed to build program, although the code
      that actually uses fonts is not yet active.

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>


2006.Nov.17  (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 61)
  Version 1.0.2

  Build:
    * Support for native MacOSX build (G4-PPC, OSX 10.4) - now 
      has "macapp" target in Makefile.

      Tim Holy <holy@wustl.edu>

2006.Nov.17  (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 58)
  Version 1.0.1

  Game:
    * Two simple bugfixes for config file input not setting
      the correct parameter.
    * Minor updates to docs.

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>


2006.Oct.31 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 54)
  Version 1.0

  Docs:
    * Updated changelog, README.txt, INSTALL.txt, TODO.txt.

2006.Oct.30 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 53)
  Version 0.98

  Code:
    * Minor bug fix to prevent the game from asking questions
      with an indeterminate answer (i.e. 0 / ? = 0).
      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2006.Oct.20

  Build:
    * More support for Windows crossbuild under linux added
      to svn, including cross-configure.sh and cross-make.sh 
      scripts and minor changes to configure.in and Makefile.am
      when building for Windows.
  Code:
    * game_options struct now has complete set of accessor
      functions with sanity checks to keep impossible values
      from getting read in from config files.  This is in
      options.c. This fixes several ways in which the program
      could previously be crashed, and also cleans up 
      read_config_file() as it no longer needs to do any
      sanity testing.

2006.Oct.07 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 48)
  Version 0.97 final

  Build:
    * removed icon* from Makefile.am as its included in data

      Holger Levsen <debian@layer-acht.org>

2006.Oct.07 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 47)

  Build:
    * Many files needed for build using autotools added to svn
      that I previously left out by accident.
    * autogen.sh added, now build and install under *nix using:
         ./autogen.h && ./configure && make && make install
    * make install no longer copies .svn files into data dir

2006.Sep.29 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 28)
  Version 0.97

  Build:
    * Successful Windows XP build including all current features,
      config file handling, game summaries.
    * Build system changed to autoconf/automake. fileops.h/fileops.c
      changed to accomodate cross-platform build. Under Linux/Unix,
      now install with ./configure && make && make install.

      Yves Combe <yves@ycombe.net>

2006.Sep.22 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 27)
  Version 0.96
  
  Game:
    * Tuxmath now saves summaries of the last ten games in
      the player's .tuxmath directory. They are rotated out,
      with the oldest discarded each time. The summaries
      include the starting question list, a list of all
      missed questions, and the numbers of correct and 
      incorrect answers with percent correct.
      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2006.Sep.18 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 26)
  Version 0.95

  Setup:
    * Config file output cleaned up with better organization
      and better comments.
  Game:
    * Feedback system implemented to dynamically adjust comet
      speed based on player performance.
      Tim Holy <holy@wustl.edu>
  Code:
    * Fixed bug causing crash if max_comets set too high.
      Tim Holy <holy@wustl.edu>
    * Fixed bug causing crash due to SDL_FreeSurface() being
      called twice on same pointer in certain code path.
      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>
     

2006.Sep.03 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 22)
  Version 0.94

  Setup:
    * Math question formats (answer last, answer first, etc.)
      are now set independently for each math operation, e.g.
      "format_add_answer_last", etc.
  Code:
    * Mathcards now prints questions in same format as what
      appears in game (e.g. "2 + 2 = ?").  So far this is 
      only used for debugging output, but soon tuxmath will
      save lists of questions asked and questions missed to 
      files for post-game review.
      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2006.Sep.03 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 21)
  Version 0.93

  Code:
    * config.h/c now called fileops.h/c and all code related to
      file operations contained here (config files as well as
      loading of image and sound data files). Both images.h and 
      sound.h have been incorporated into fileops.h. Idea is to
      have only one place for OS-specific code, if possible.
    * setup() split into several smaller functions.
    * If a sound file cannot be loaded, the program continues 
      without sound rather than exiting. Bug fixed that caused 
      this to turn off sound for subsequent games (thanks Tim Holy).
    * All global data now extern'd in same place in tuxmath.h.
  Setup:
    * Better handling of config files.  Program now creates 
      .tuxmath directory in user's home, config file is in this
      directory and is called "options".  Global config file
      located in new "missions" folder in program data (this 
      will change to something under /etc or /usr/local/etc when
      I have studied FHS and makefiles more).
    * Added "--optionfile filename" command-line arg (thanks Yves
      Combe for suggestion) - program will look for 'filename' in
      several locations including as absolute path.
  Docs:
    * Updates to changelog and TODO.txt; update to usage();
      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2006.Aug.22 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 20)
  Version 0.92

  Code:
    * Patch to allow program to exit more gracefully
      if unable to load data files - primarily, the screen 
      resolution goes back to normal instead of staying at
      640x480.
      David Yoder <hobie20dude@gmail.com>

2006.Aug.13 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 19)
  Version 0.91

  Code:
    * Fixed embarrassing bug in revision 18/version 0.9 that 
      caused program to crash with segmentation fault if 
      TUXMATH_DEBUG disabled (which was how it was committed).
      :^(
      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2006.Aug.11 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 18)
  Version 0.9 

  Setup:
    * Tuxmath now reads and writes all settings to disc in human-
      readable form. The first time it is run by each user, it
      creates a config file (called .tuxmath for now) in the user's
      home directory  The settings are initially set to hard-coded
      defaults, then overridden as needed by a master config file
      (for now located in DATA_PREFIX i.e. /usr/local/share/tuxmath),
      then overridden if desired by the user's own config file.
      The settings are saved from game to game if the file is left
      unchanged.  Any text editor can be used to modify the settings.
      The config file contains extensive comments documenting
      all settings.  Complete control over program behavior is now
      available without recompiling.
    * tuxmath -h output updated with prominent notice that config
      file now being used.
  Game:
    * By default the game now plays through the question list and 
      ends with "Victory" when all questions correctly answered.
    * game.c now handles 'slow_after_wrong' and other comet and speed
      settings correctly.
    * title screen has shortcuts 'P' for Play, 'O' for Options, etc.
  Code:
    * names of some of settings in game_options and math_options
      structs changed to more intuitive/descriptive ones.
  Docs:
    * Updates to README.txt and TODO.txt
      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2006.Jun.17 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 10)
  Docs:
    * Updates to README.txt and TODO.txt.
    * Version designated as 0.8 in README.txt, tuxmath.h, and Makefile.

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2006.Jun.12 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 9)
  Game:
    * Command-line argument added to allow ending the game with
      "victory" when all questions in the defined list have been
      successfully answered.
    * Counter of remaining questions added to upper center of screen
      when operating in "defined list" mode.
    * LED numbers now display in "monitor" added to Tux's console
      when "defined list" mode selected".
    * Drawing of math question formulas overhauled, with support
      for display of negatives (e.g. 2 x -3 = ?). The program supports
      negative numbers for limits of question ranges, but for now
      this must be selected at compile time.
    * Support for questions formatted like ? + 2 = 4 and 2 + ? = 4, 
      in addition to default format (2 + 2 = ?).
    * Command-line options to select from the three question formats.

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>

2006.May.16 (https://svn.tux4kids.net/tuxmath/ - revision 8)
  Code:
    * Major changes to internal workings of program. Everything 
      related to generation of math questions is now handled by
      a backend called MathCards, which generates question lists
      based on parameters in a struct called math_opts. MathCards
      is (obviously) contained in two new files, mathcards.h and
      mathcards.c.  For now, many options can only be set at 
      compile time by changing the defaults in mathcards.h. 
      MathCards allows fine-grained control of the questions to
      be asked, and allows the player to "win" if all of the
      questions in the list are answered while the cities are
      still alive.  By default, game behavior is unchanged from
      previously.
    * Main game() function in game.c has been split into several
      smaller functions; updated to use MathCards. 
    * Options() updated to use MathCards.
  Game:
    * demo mode now handles negative answers properly.

  Note: the code contains many FIXMEs and TODOs and should be
      tested more before being packaged for a distribution.
      I would describe revision 8 as a developer or alpha release.

      David Bruce <dbruce@tampabay.rr.com>
