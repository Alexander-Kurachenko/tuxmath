Source tar.gz archive for TuxMath 1.6.0, including the Andika font.  Suitable for installation on Unix-style systems using a simple "./configure; make; make install".

Build requires the *-dev files for SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, and SDL_ttf. Gnu gettext is no longer required for installation. All of these should be easily available in most Gnu-Linux distributions. The Gnu Autotools are not needed to build from this package.
